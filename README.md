- 👋 Hi, I'm @pantera-rosa, a software engineer currently open to new opportunities.
- 🐜 I mostly have experience in frontend development (React/JS+TS) but love to write in Go/Python and would like to work more on APIs and serverless & cloud technologies (AWS & GCP).
- 📫 Reach out to me [via email](ch7bacgqb7@privaterelay.appleid.com) and check out https://ilonabodn.ar for an overview of my work experience.
